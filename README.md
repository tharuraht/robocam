# robocam

## TODO

- verify if there is a latency difference between profiles, select best one
- find the 'auto' keyframe interval (print it out?)
- possibly add framerate profiles depending on network conditions (e.g. lower framerate, more keyframes)
- change RTSP config to use Secure RTP (see profiles option for rtsp client sink)
- enable username and password for RTSP
- add overlay showing connection information to pi
